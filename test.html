<h3>Background</h3> 

INTACT INSURANCE UK LIMITED formerly known as ROYAL & SUN ALLIANCE INSURANCE LIMITED who operated brands like More Than Insurance. <br> 

<p>https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/00093792</p>  

<p>Information on this website is intentionally incomplete as more information will be released over time.</p> 

<h3> Bullying </h3> 

<p> In 2021, Leonie Soul made a new starter cry. She was this employee’s senior and this was witnessed by multiple staff members. </p> 

<h3> Leonie Soul work avoidance – lying about the Romero cases 2021 </h3> 

<h3> J Doe complained about Ashley McGhee and Leonie Soul to Ann Owen </h3> 

<h3> Using deceased father as leverage </h3> 

<p> An employee at Intact lost their dad and as a result, had to take time off work. Since then, Ashley McGhee and Ann Owen used this bereavement time off to mistreat this employee. This employee happens to be a woman of colour. Ann Owen and Ashley McGhee used the bereavement to justify why this employee was paid less than her white male counter parts whom had less tenure and experience. They also used this reasoning to justify not giving a fair salary increase to match these comparators over a year later. </p> 

<p> This abusive tactic caused the employee to have multiple mental break downs at work, to which Ann Owen tried to use to fire the employee. </p> 

<h3> Leonie Soul often citing without prompt her ex-boyfriend’s religion whilst calling him a devil </h3> 

<h3> Leonie Soul passing work to her team yet accused a member of the same team of work avoidance </h3> 

<h3> Leonie Soul shouting at J. Doe in front of colleagues </h3>

<h3> Ashley McGhee salary comment </h3>

<h3> Ann Owen not caring about mental health and J. Doe feeling suicidal. Ann Owen tried to unlawfully fire this employee</h3> 

<h3> J. Doe assaulted by male staff member. Reported to Ashley McGhee who hid the facts and refused to co-operate police investigations </h3> 

<h3> Ashley McGhee inappropriately telling J. Doe about his personal life and crying about it including the unprompted disclosure of his partner cheating on him. He became out of breathe from crying </h3> 

<h3> Ashley McGhee offered all expenses paid for work trips to white male staff members only and hiding this from people of colour staff members and female staff members. This action was supported by Dermot Hillen, Margaret McAllister, Ann Owen, Audra Duncan and Intact Insurance. </h3> 

<h3> Fraud of Audra Duncan </h3> 

<h3> Racially and Religiously Aggravated Harassment (Crime and Disorder Act 1998 / Protection from Harassment Act 1997) </h3> 

<h3> Disability Hate Crime </h3> 

<h3> Criminal Fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud (Criminal Law Act 1977 & Fraud Act 2006) </h3> 

<p> Multiple managers coordinated to manufacture false data regarding "work avoidance" and "integrity breaches." </p> 

<h3> Conspiracy to manufacture false grounds for dismissal and related events </h3> 

<p> Several senior employees at RSA, including Ashley McGhee, Margaret McAllister, Leonie Soul, Dermot Hillen, and Sandy Hillyard, coordinated actions to falsely accuse J. Doe of serious misconduct to attempt to remove J. Doe from the company. They accused J. Doe of: </p> 

Work avoidance 

Failure to follow procedure 

Breaching FCA Conduct Rule 1: Acting with Integrity 

<p> These accusations were constructed with: </p> 

Falsified data 

Misleading narrative building 

Suppressed exonerating evidence 

<p> The intent behind these actions were: </p> 

Forcing J. Doe dismissal from RSA. 

Damaging J. Doe reputation with regulatory bodies (specifically, the FCA), meaning J. DOE could never get an FCA regulated role again. The perpetrators all knew J. Doe experience, education and skills were formatted for FCA regulated roles. 

Preventing J. Doe from accessing overtime while financially vulnerable 

Reducing J. Doe eligibility for higher performance-based bonuses 

<p> An internal RSA investigation conducted by a separate employee, John Bush, ultimately found that J. DOE had not committed any misconduct. His findings cleared J. Doe of the allegations. However, by this point, significant damage had already been done. </p> 

<h3> Discriminatory Removal of Work Access During Disciplinary Process with the intention for J. Doe to be unable to defend wrongful accusations </h3> 

<h3> Ann Owen making a racist comment at work, Audra Duncan the recipient not the target </h3>
